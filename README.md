## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**v-Farhad/v-Farhad** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I am enjoying my stay in Dallas, while working towards my PhD at SMU
My PhD is about privacy preservation in vehicular systems, and I am doing my best (and even more) to apply FHE-based methods to real-world engineering problems. So far so good!
