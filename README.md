## About MEEEE ðŸ‘‹

The EEEE may show my excitment for writing about me. Or, it may be interpreted as a sign of narcissim. I am fine with both.

Though a little old for being a student, I am a PhD student at SMU in Dallas, Texas. I am currently working on privacy in vehicular systems, doing my best (and even more) to apply FHE-based methods to real-world engineering problems. So Far So Good!

My PhD supervisor, Dr. Camp, has a big lab, mostly occupied with drones and wireless equipment. Later robot dogs will be added. The lab helps the science community proceed with swarm intelligence. Hopefully, as time passes, I will extend FHE methods to swarm intelligence algos and test it in practical settings.

The following is my thoughts on what is happening in tech right now: As AI evolves (OpenAI o3 is called AGI by some), it becomes more and more clear (at least to me) that every firm will need to have access to a private LLM to advance their mega projects securely. Simply, this cannot be possible, unless we cover every place on the earth with data centers. Similar to the cloud computing technology that did not get enough attention from established firms, LLMs will not be trusted without a mechanism that ensures data privacy. 

Taking into account the above, as it ensures privacy at the node level, FHE is going to be one of three main players offering a solution for the data privacy problem in LLMs. No doubt, it is slow now, but it won't be soon.
